# Robustness audit (2026-11-10)

A read of the plugin for what makes it say something untrue, leak an internal name, or lose a feature to one bad read,
with the play logs of 2026-11-08 to 2026-11-10 beside it. What was fixed that day is listed first; the rest is open, most
player-visible first, each with where it lives.

## Fixed on 2026-11-10

- The passive tree's stick self-check reported a game update when it lost the rule (four times in two days, each "7 hit,
  3 missed"): no longer reported; it also skips pushes it cannot judge (a push it expects to move nothing, one whose pick
  changes ten degrees to either side, the first after the zoom or Y) (`UiSemantics.PassiveTree.JudgeStickLanding`).
- "lejos" for any way the rule could not count: now only when the way is longer than counted (`PassiveStick.Route`'s
  `ranOut`); a stuck or untrusted way is its side alone.
- A part found again before it was said missing was still said missing (`CompatibilityReport.Note`).
- One failed read of the allocated list read as "nothing allocated" (kept for two seconds now); a failed edge search
  silenced the tree for the session (three tries, ten seconds apart, now); the class's own start cached as none.
- "poise" missing after thirty bad ticks in total, however many areas (two areas must agree now); "walkable" on one
  window of thirty cells (two windows now) (`WorldLayoutWatch`).
- A held item said by its file path when its entity was already gone (`InventoryWatch.TickHand`): tried again for a
  second, then "unknown item".
- The scanner's "sin ruta" at a cut the player stood on (`EntityCatalog.Describe`): said as cut.
- A quest's name making a town's well the objective (`QuestTexts`, [ui layers](ui-layers.md)).

## Fixed on 2026-11-10, second pass

Each with a unit test in `RobustnessTests` unless said.

- `PassiveTreeFields.JudgeAllocated`: the list where measured is kept while it names the graph's nodes with at most one id in
  ten unknown (a class override node may stand there under an id the records do not give; `AllocatedListCheck`); it is moved
  only when under one id in ten is known and another list of the state holds three or more ids, each once, all known; said lost
  on the second such reading, ten seconds apart. A list in between is not judged. Ids gathered from under half the records
  (rows not readable yet) judge nothing. The shown row's graph id is still not known to the check: that needs
  `UiSemantics.GraphIdOf` to give both rows' ids (not done: another owner's file).
- `BossWatch.WatchLife`: a boss is defeated when it read not alive and no living reading came for half a second
  (`BossLifeSteps.Defeated`, `ConfirmDefeats`; a corpse the game removed in between counts); a unique whose `Positioned` says
  friend is not tracked (no unit test: a host entity).
- `AttackFieldCheck`: the six verdicts of the dodge fields start over with each game process (`BossWatch.ResetLayout`, called
  beside `FlagBits.Reset`).
- `MonsterMods.Name`: a row is cached only once its name read, or its first character is the terminator (no unit test: reads
  through the host).
- `TradeOfferWatch`: where measured first (grid, grid, title, title); in a body of twelve children or fewer laid out another
  way, the only two grids (`TryReadGrid`) and the only two texts, paired in order (`TradeOfferNews.Sides`).
- `FlagBits.EnabledTrusted`: judged on every pre-game screen until one shows the bit working; lost only when two different
  screens have under 20% of their controls enabled, and given back by any screen that shows it (`EnabledBitCheck`).
- `LayoutProbe` (entity names): settled only by a batch that reads; missing once two different batches read none, ten
  seconds apart or more (`LossWitnesses`).
- `CullSkills.Load`, `HazardGround.Load`: a file in use loads empty. `GameNews` is not guarded here (another owner's file).

## Open

| Where | What can go wrong | Smallest fix |
|---|---|---|
| `UiSemantics.GraphIdOf` | The allocated list's check knows a node by its replaced row only | Give the shown row's id too (`ShownRow`) |
| `UiSemantics.PassiveTree.PlacesOf` | Places are kept for the nodes visible at the first read: the ascendancy's 197 nodes get none | Rebuild when the count of visible node elements changes |
| `UiSemantics.BuildPlanner.BuildMarks` | The build mark byte has one signature; moved by a patch, any byte equal to 1 marks nodes | Treat the marks as unreadable when over a quarter of the nodes read 1 |
| `UiSemantics.PassiveTree` (`StickLinksOf`) | The row byte that makes the game skip the linked stage is read and ignored; the multiple-choice redirect is not modelled (the first push after an attribute popup lands one node off) | Empty links for such rows; skip them in the self-check |
| `ComboBoxReader` | The first decoding that yields text is used for every dropdown | Latch after two dropdowns agree |
| `Beacon` | A route task that failed or ran out of budget is said like "no route yet" | Say it after two nulls; tell budget from unreachable |
| `EntityCatalog.Classify` (`ObjectNames.FromPath`) | An object no table names is said by its file's words, in English ("Chair") | Speak them only as a last resort, marked as unnamed outside English |
| `GameNews` | A catalog read with no IO guard: a locked file throws | The guard the other loaders have |

Not faults, by the logs: the vitals' thresholds re-arm with a margin (154 "Vida 50 por ciento" in two days of fights);
a targeted monster's name is said each time the target changes; the terms of use read their 248 paragraphs.
